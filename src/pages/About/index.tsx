    <h2>What is this?</h2>
    <p>
      This is a simple mindmap editor. It&apos;s a work in progress, and
      it&apos;s not very good yet. But it&apos;s getting there.
    </p>
    <h2>What&apos;s the point?</h2>
    <p>
      We want to make a mindmap editor that&apos;s easy to use, and that allows
      for rapid, collaborative, ai-assisted ideation. We&apos;re also trying to
      make it viewable and navigatable on touchscreen mobile devices, and to
      make it easy to ideate with a keyboard and mouse.
    </p>
    <h2>How do I use it?</h2>
    <p>
      You can create a new mindmap by clicking the &quot;New Mindmap&quot;
      button in the top right corner. You can also click the
      &quot;Mindmaps&quot; button in the top left corner to see a list of all
      your mindmaps. You can click the &quot;Help&quot; button in the top right
      corner to see a list of keyboard shortcuts.
    </p>
    <h2>How do I collaborate?</h2>
    <p>
      You can share a mindmap by clicking the &quot;Share&quot; button in the
      top right corner. You can then copy the link and send it to someone else.
      They can then open the link in their browser and they will be able to edit
      the mindmap with you.
